Intro:
Hi my name is Mewan. A Master student from Carnegie Mellon University specializing on Software Engineering.

Prior to my professional program @ CMU - I worked at ThoughtWorks close to 4 years as a aplication developer and software consultant. 
I am an agile full stack developer and generalist i.e. the main part of my job description @Thoughtworks is that I must be able to pick up any new technology stack in two weeks time. 
That way I got a chance to work on many kinds of projects (Web - Java, C#.Net, Mobile, FrontEnd) and many roles like a full stack developer, angularJs developer, android developer to a devOps engineer.

Currently I am on a fulltime 1 year capstone project at CMU working with TrustedFamily creating Data Visualization for their family data using D3, NodeJs and MongoDb where I am the Architect and Tech lead.
